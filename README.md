Primary purpose of this library subsystem and integration test development for REST services. Latest version of package can be found on Nuget.org using the following link to [GodelTech.StoryLine.Rest](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GodelTech.StoryLine.Rest/) package.

The following projects may be also useful during development of tests for REST services:
* [GodelTech.StoryLine.Wiremock](https://github.com/GodelTech/GodelTech.StoryLine.Wiremock) provides fluent syntax for [Wiremock](http://wiremock.org/) tool. This tool is used to stub behavior of dependencies (other REST services) which tested service interacts with.
* [GodelTech.StoryLine.Utils](https://github.com/GodelTech/GodelTech.StoryLine.Utils) contains set of helper actions and expectations which can simplify such activities as artifact expectation development, waiting for results, transformation of artifacts and etc.
* [GodelTech.StoryLine.Rest.Coverage](https://github.com/GodelTech/GodelTech.StoryLine.Rest.Coverage/) tool can be used to measure REST API test coverage level.
